# Sstudio-User-Dashboard
We are adding the 'Sign In' functionality. Let's create a dashboard for users who sign in. The basic functionality will cover:  1) Profile: Where users can edit/update their profile and package plan they are on. 2) Tasks: Where users can initiate a task enter the details of projects they would like to execute-including timeline/deadline. 3) History: Showing Project history 4) Settings: Where users can enter payment details and other basic settings info 

I Have included an sql file for the db operations..
Also, a config folder is needed a directory up of the dashboard directory to set up the constants for mysql operations
